1. A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.

Compare the neighborhoods of the multiple cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are.
For example, is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city?

First of all, I am a Taiwanese living in Taipei. 
In our country, we don't have a long history so there are few historic buildings in our country.
In contract, we have lots and lots of street vendors, convenience stores therefore it is convenience.

I want to figure out if I decide to live in other country, which is suitble for me (that I can quickly get used to it)? 
I also want to figure out if I want to travel to see different countries, which are sutible for me (that is very different from Taipei)?

I'll choose 20 cities and find out the answers for myself.
